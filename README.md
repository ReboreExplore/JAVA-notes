# JAVA - notes
This repository contains the notes from the free code camp series of JAVA. It serves as a revision material for my future projects. This is prepared from this you tube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoXwIVyNvX0&t=2297s). This is a course created by [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg) on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ).
